## Important
This script aims to automate eduroam network connection in **Politecnico di Milano**. Therefore, if you are from any other universities, it won't work! 


## Requirement
You must have `nmcli` and `openssl` installed

After executing the script, you have to manually activate the connection using `nmcli con up <SSID>`


The network is quite slow tho...
